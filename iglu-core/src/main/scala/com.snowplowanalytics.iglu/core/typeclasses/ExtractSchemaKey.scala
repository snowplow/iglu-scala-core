/**
  * This type class can be used to extract a [[SchemaKey]] from a piece
  * of self-describing data.
  *
  * The [[SchemaKey]] contains details about the schema of the data.
  *
  * An example input is:
  *
  * {{{
  *   {
  *      "schema": "iglu:com.vendor/user_entity/jsonschema/1-0-0",
  *      "data": {
  *         "id": "78abb66e-a5ad-4772-96ec-d880650cd0b2",
  *         "email": "some_user@example.com"
  *      }
  *    }
  * }}}
  *
  * where "schema" contains information about the vendor, name, format and
  * version of the schema and can be extracted as [[SchemaKey]].
  *
  * @tparam E Any type that can include a reference to its own schema.
  *           It's mostly intended for various JSON ADTs,
  *           like Json4s, Jackson, Circe, Argonaut et al,
  *           but can also be something like Thrift, Map[String, String], etc.
